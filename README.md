# Wikipedia Q&A bot 

The RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) application built on Mixtral's 8*7b LLM model allows users to input a URL corresponding to a Wikipedia page. Users can then engage in natural language conversations, asking questions related to the content of the specified Wikipedia page, with the model providing informative and contextually relevant responses.
